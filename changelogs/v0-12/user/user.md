# Connect X v0.12 (May 3, 2020)

## New features

In this iteration, the Connect X _New Game_ and _Game_ views have been created.


## New Game view

When launching Connect X, the first view that appears on screen is the _New Game_ view. This view allows the user to create a new game with the wanted parameters. This view allows specifying:

 * the in-a-row value;
 * the grid width and height;
 * two players (names and disc color, as a string).

The in-a-row and game dimensions text boxes can take any positive integer value. The player fields take string values. All fields cannot be empty for a new game to be valid. When valid information is entered by the user, the "Start" button will allow switching to the _Game_ view.


## Game view

The Game view displays the following information:

 * the in-a-row value;
 * the grid width and height;
 * a list of player names.

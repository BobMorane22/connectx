# Connect X v0.1 (December 1st, 2019)

## New features

In this iteration, a demo executable, `connectx`, has been created. For now, the only supported operating system is Ubuntu 18.04. The executable has not been tested on anything else, but should work on most GNU/Linux systems.


## Running the executable

You can run the executable from the command line:

```
./connectx
```

which prints the string _Hello World!_ to the console:

```
Hello World!
```

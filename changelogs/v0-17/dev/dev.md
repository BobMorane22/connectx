# Connect X v0.17 (October 11, 2020)

## Sprint objectives

In the current sprint:

1. create a grid model;
2. create visible and scalable chips.


## Grid model

The Connect X grid (representing the game board) is abstracted in the model with the `cxmodel::IBoard` interface.


## Scalable chips

This feature is fully documented [here](../user/user.md).


## Backlog file

Note the presence of the `backlog.md` file in the root directory. This file should be used to keep track of tasks to be (eventually) transferred into the project management system. It is different than the `whishlist.md` file: instead of tracking interesting long term ideas, it tracks observations a developer can make on the code (a possible refactoring, a bug, a forgotten piece to cover, unit tests to add, etc). All of these observations should, in the short term, be written to the project management system and removed from the `backlog.md` file.

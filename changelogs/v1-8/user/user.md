# Connect X v1.8 (January 7, 2023)

## New features

In this iteration:

1. The first player can now be a bot.


## First player can be a bot

Up to now, the first player could not be a bot. From now on,
it can be. The only limitation is that, for any given game,
at least one player is human. If this is not the case, the
game cannot be started until the situation is rectified.

## Undo/Redo

Some user actions can now be undoed and redoed through undo and redo buttons on the UI.

For example, if a user incremented the value one too many times, he or she can click _Undo_ and the value will come back to its last value. Visually, it will look as if if were decremented by one. Similarly, the user can then click _Redo_ to put the value back at the same state it was before _Undo_ was clicked.

For now, undoable actions are:

1. Increment;
2. Reinitialize.

Note that some actions cannot be undoed or redoed. For example, scaling the window is one such action.

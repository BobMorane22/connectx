# Connect X v1.0 (February 12, 2023)

## New features

In this iteration:

1. The mouse can now be used to interact with the game board.


## Mouse interactions

Up to now, interacting with the game board could only be done using the keyboard:

 * right/left arrows to move around;
 * down arrow to drop a chip.

While this was acceptable for small boards, it became really painful on larger boards.
Furthermore, most users had a hard time figuring out how to interact with the board.
Their first reflex usually was to grab the mouse, only to notice nothing happened.

From now on, moving the mouse around the board automatically highlights the column
under the mouse pointer and clicking the mouse drops the chip into the column under
the mouse pointer at the moment of the click.

# Connect X v1.4 (Month DD, YYYY)

## New features

In this iteration:

1. The _Game_ view performance is increased.


## Increased performance for the _Game_ view.

Using the arrow keys to move the chip around made high usage of the CPU
resources. Since Connect X is only a small game, this was unacceptable.
The way rendering is done in the _Game_ view has been reviewed, and the
CPU usage is now back to normal.

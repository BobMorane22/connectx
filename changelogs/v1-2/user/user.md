# Connect X v1.2 (March 19, 2023)

## New features

In this iteration:

1. A gravity effect has been added to the dropped chip animation.
2. Default values for new games have been introduced.


## Gravity effect

Up to now, the animation triggered when a chip was dropped in the board
did not feel natural. The problem was that the speed was constant
and the effect of gravity was not taken into account. A gravity feel
has now been added to the animation, which looks way more natural.


## Default values for new games

Up to now, the New Game view forced the user to pick game values for
the in-a-row value and the board dimensions. For player names and disc
colors, default values were there. Default values now exist for all
controls when entering the New Game view. The default values are those
of a classic Connect 4 game:

 - In-a-row : 4
 - Board dimensions : 6 by 7

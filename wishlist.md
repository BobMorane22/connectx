# Wishlist for Connect X

These ideas are not ready yet to become official story in Taiga. For now, they are kept here as wishes that might, some day, become a reality:

- Add a save feature: users can save the current game state and come back to it later.
- Add a crash handler (report with log, message to user, machine/OS information, etc.)
- Add a playback feature: users can check a replay of passed games.
- Add a game export feature: users can export a finished game in a report. They can trace
  back their moves for a game.
- Add user configurations to save some parameters (i.e. window positioning, scaling, etc).
- Add a sound player.
- Add utf8 support inside the model.
- Add portable help system (one that can be maintained only once, but displayed offline,
  inside the application and also online).
- Add animations for the Grid widget. Discs should fall smoothly (gravity feel).
- In `cxgui`, add global GUI settings that can be reused across windows and widgets
  (spacing between widgets, fonts, etc).
- Add functionnalities to allow for visually impaired people to play.

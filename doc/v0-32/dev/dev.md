# Connect X v0.32 (Month DD, YYYY)

## New features

In this iteration:

1. New math library added.


## Math library

A new library named `cxmath` has been added. Its goal is to hold all mathematical constants,
functions and classes. All of what is included in `cxmath` should have no knowledge of Connect X
itself: it should stay a pure math library (that could be reused elswhere with no modifications).
Its only allowed dependency is the `cxassert` library.

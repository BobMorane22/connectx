# Connect X v0.4 (January 12, 2019)

## New features

A GUI that lets the user increment a counter.


## Counter GUI

A minimal GUI lets the user increment a counter. On application launch, the user is presented with the following:

![Initial](./window.png)

The user can use the _Increment_ button to increment by one the value printed on the window:

![With count](./window2.png)

The _Reinitialize_ button can be used to reset the counter value to its initial value (0). Note that if the counter is already showing its initial value, the _Reinitialize_ button is not enabled. This is why, when launching the application, the button is not enabled.

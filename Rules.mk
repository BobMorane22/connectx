### Configurations.
#
# If nothing has been specified when calling 'make' use the debug configuration. This is
# the most typical case when developping.

### Subdirectories, in build order.
#
# These are the lower level directories in which some "Rules.mk" file exist and must
# be handled here to ensure correct build of the target. Note that if these directories
# themselves contain subdirectories with lower level "Rules.mk" files of their own, these
# low level sub-directories must NOT be handled here. They must be handled in their parent
# directory's "Rules.mk" file for the recursive inclusion process to work as expected.

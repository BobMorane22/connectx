### Updating current directory on stack
#
# Saves the variable "d" that holds the current directory on the stack, and sets it to the current
# directory given in "dir" (a parameter to the make fragment file).
#
# A textual "stack pointer" (sp) is used to keep track of the recursion depth of the include
# process. We "increment it" by adding a ".x" suffix to it.
#
sp := $(sp).x
dirstack_$(sp) := $(d)
d := $(dir)


### Local variables
#
# To the global variable "TGT_BIN", we add the Connect X executable.
#
# To the global variable "CLEAN", we add the files that the rules present here may create,
# i.e. the ones we want deleted by a "make clean" command.
#
TGTS_$(d) := $(d)/connectx

             cxlog/libcxlog.a \
             cxmodel/libcxmodel.a \

# changes to header files are recognized by make.

### Local rules
#
# Executable is compiled and linked.
#
# Since the executable needs to access all libraries, we make sure its include directory
# is the project root. That way, all include files can be found.
#
$(OBJS_$(d)): CF_TGT := -I. -I$(d)/include `pkg-config gtkmm-3.0 --cflags --libs`

# Here we add the unit test executable as an "order-only prerequisite" to make sure it is
# not included in the build process (i.e. not listed in the $^ automatic variables contents).
# In this way, we make it clear that the Connect X executable depends on its unit tests
# having been built and run sucessfully.
$(TGTS_$(d)): $(OBJS_$(d)) $(LL_TGT)# | cxexec/libcxexec.a
	@echo ~~~ Generating the executable ~~~
	$(LINK)


### Restoring stack
#
# The stack pointer is "decremented" and the last current directory is restored.
